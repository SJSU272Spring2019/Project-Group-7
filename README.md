Project Name: StudentPerformanceChecker


## Project Description 

This web application is intended to provide the students the ability to monitor their academic performances with the help of a machine learning algorithm running on top of the application. The students can gain more knowledge and grow multiple times faster in terms of achieving a pinnacle of success. The teachers also have a few  burdens off their shoulders and they can invest this time in a more productive way to build the curriculum.
